# Factorio Visual
Visualization of recipes from computer game Factorio (<https://www.factorio.com>)
The idea of this project is to display all recipes including the ones which are in the mods.

## Start

  1. [Download ZIP](<https://github.com/Fabian-Schmidt/FactorioVisual/archive/master.zip>).
  2. Extract the ZIP archive into the Factorio game folder.
  3. Start ```<Facotio folder>\FactorioVisual-master\start.bat```.
This will start a web server and your default browser will open with the application.
  4. Give it some time to load all mods. On my machine with Bobs mods it takes ~30 seconds.

## Usage

  - In the upper section select from the list of recipes the one to visualize.
  - Below a graph will apear with the ingrediants and possible recipes from the resulting item.
  - On the bottom a calculation area will be created for optimization nerds.
